# Museum

This Project is my first year project exam
An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents.
The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering;
it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent.
