            <div class="information-article">
                <p>We are committed to making science accessible to all.
                    Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind,
                    water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life
                    itself.
                    The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
                    discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world
                    around us.
                    We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.

                <div class="information-article">
                    <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for
                        visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of
                        a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers
                        come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
                        You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out
                        more about how you can get involved.
